# marathon-training
Post-race breakdown of the 2022 Baltimore Marathon aimed at informing training for 2023. Currenty I'm working on understanding how my body reacts to hot weather, which is particularly relevant given the fact that it is currently April. I'm doing this by assuming that the dominant three factors influencing my pace on any given day are temperature, distance, and the flatness of the route. Unfortunately these variables aren't uniformally distributed which is going to complicate things a little bit, but I'll improvise, adapt, and overcome.

I still have my 2022 training plan written down somewhere, so it would probably be a good idea to spend some time tagging the data by what type of run each activity was. That's going to take more time than I'm willing to commit for a spare time project unfortunately, so it will have to be relegated to a later date. When I do that though, the three main categories I should use are:

1. General aerobic
2. Anaerobic (track workout)
3. Recovery run
4. Long run

Then of course that'll be another factor I'll want to disentangle. The last one that I'll need to think about eventually is of course the fact that I got better as a runner throughout the training. That means that date is probably going to play a factor in performance. I'll cross that bridge when I come to it though.
